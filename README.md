# Dynamo-Blockchain

## Part I: Executive Summary

The online-gaming industry has become a global ecosystem of hundreds of millions of players coming together to both play against each other, but also exchange items with one-another in- game marketplaces. Major gaming platforms have their own marketplaces facilitating the buying and selling of virtual gaming items that can then be used inside games. In 2020, these marketplaces generated $33 billion in revenue. Such lucrative products need to continuously be streamlined, revamped, and innovated upon to make sure that gamers are getting the best experience. After analyzing the user journey in today’s gaming marketplaces, we highlighted various inefficiencies (e.g. high transaction fees, siloed marketplaces, differing Foreign Exchange rates) and have developed a solution to solve them - we call it Dynamo!
Dynamo leverages smart contracts, NFTs, and APIs, to provide gamers with a marketplace where they can trade online game items from various games all in one place! By leveraging blockchain technology, transactions are instantly settled, there is one common currency, and transaction fees are minimized. Our smart contracts offers fast, transparent, secure, and reliable transactions between buyers and sellers,
We’re excited to show you our platform, our smart contracts, and walk you through our user journey.

## Part II: Problem Statement

**Introduction**

The online-gaming industry has expanded to become a global ecosystem of millions of players interacting with each other. To capitalize on this interconnected network of players, popular online gaming platforms such as Steam, OP.GG, Itch.io, and Battle.net have created marketplaces where players from around the world can trade items such as skins and weapons from within the game. These marketplaces have become one of the most lucrative avenues for these platforms - in 2020, online gaming marketplaces generated $33 billion in revenue.
This revenue isn’t just for the gaming platforms, but a lot of players actually base their income around flipping these types of items (they buy a weapon for a specific price, wait till it appreciates, and then sell it at a higher price). With so much money involved for both players and the platforms, we believe that these marketplaces need to be as efficient as possible.
After studying the current user journey in the marketplace from both a buyer (a gamer who buys an item in the marketplace) and seller (a gamer who puts an item for sale on the marketplace) perspective, we’ve found major areas that we believe blockchain/smart contracts can solve for.

**Problem Statement**

  1. Gamer’s don’t just play on one website. Gamers access multiple gaming marketplaces, but they are all siloed.
  2. No common currency for global gaming community. FX rates differ, leading to a potential mismatch between the buy/sell price
  3. Lengthy (2+ days) settlement times for deposit and withdrawal. No instant transactions for both buyers and sellers. No major gaming platforms accept cryptocurrencies
  4. Gamers are the strongest advocates for Web3, DeFi, and NFT’s

**Product Idea**

Product Vision: Create a online-gaming items marketplace that enables truly global, instant, and secure trades.

  1. Dynamo is a gaming NFT marketplace, where each NFT represents an actual item from a traditional gaming marketplace.
  2. Through the use of APIs and smart contracts, Dynamo helps gamer mint their items from Steam into an NFT. Gamers can browse through NFTs in our marketplace and buy what they like using their connected Metamask wallet.
  3. Once sold, the information will be relayed back to the gaming platform who will then swap the item from buyer to seller.
